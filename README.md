# SolitaireGame
The most popular solitare game is called klondike. 

It can be described as follows: 
The layout of the game is shown in the ﬁgure below. 
A single standard pack of 52 cardsisused. (i.e. 4suits(spades♠, diamonds♦, hearts♥, clubs♣)and13cards(13 ranks) in each suit.). 
The tableau, or playing table, consists of 28 cards in 7 piles. The ﬁrst pile has 1 card, the second 2, the third 3, and so on up to 7. 
The top card of each pile is initially face up; all other cards are face down. 
The suit piles (sometimes called foundations) are built up from aces to kings in suits. 
They are constructed above the tableau as the cards become available. 
The object of the game is to build all 52 cards into the suit piles. 
The cards that are not part of the tableau are initially all in the deck. 
Cards in the deck are face down, and are drawn one by one from the deck and placed, face up, on the discard pile. 
From there, they can be moved onto either a tableau pile or a foundation. 
Cards are drawn from the deck until the pile is empty; at this point, the game is over if no further moves can be made. 
Cards can be placed on a tableau pile only on a card of next-higher rank and opposite color. 
They can be placed on a foundation only if they are the same suit and next higher card or if the foundation is empty and the card is an ace. 
Spaces in the tableau that arise during play can be ﬁlled only by kings. 
The topmost card of each tableau pile and the topmost card of the discard pile are always available for play. 
The only time more than one card is moved is when an entire collection of face-up cards from a tableau (called a build) is moved to another tableau pile. 
This can be done if the bottommost card of the build can be legally played on the topmost card of the destination.
